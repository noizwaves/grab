Command creates context via `newContext()` loading:\n   - User config from `~/.grab/config.yml` (configRoot.Packages map[string]string)\n   - Package definitions from `~/.grab/repository/*.yml` files\n   - Creates Binary objects for each configured package\n2. Updater.Update() iterates through ALL binaries in context.Binaries\n3. For each binary: fetches latest release, compares versions, updates config if needed\n4. Saves updated config if changes were made\n\n**Key Data Structures:**\n- configRoot.Packages: map[string]string (name → version) in config.yml\n- Binary: contains package metadata, GitHub info, version info\n- Context.Binaries: slice of *Binary from user's configured packages\n\n**Integration Points for Enhancement:**\n- Command args parsing: `cmd/update.go:21` (RunE function)\n- Package filtering: needs new logic in updater or new method\n- Package validation: can use existing `locatePackage()` in `pkg/context.go:102`\n- Reuse existing update logic with filtering for single package processing",
