		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Set up comprehensive test infrastructure for TDD workflow",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the test infrastructure setup into: creating mock interfaces for GitHub API client, setting up file system operation mocks, creating test data fixtures and sample configs, extending pkg/internal/assert with installation-specific helpers, implementing mock network operations, and validating the test infrastructure doesn't break existing tests.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the need to create comprehensive mocking infrastructure across multiple systems (GitHub API, filesystem, network). Requires deep understanding of existing test patterns and careful integration to avoid breaking current tests. Foundation task that other TDD tasks depend on."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Implement command argument parsing with TDD for optional package name",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into TDD-driven subtasks: writing failing tests for argument parsing scenarios (0, 1, multiple args), implementing Cobra command extension with MaximumNArgs(1), adding argument validation and error handling, and updating help text and documentation following existing patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity as it involves extending existing Cobra command structure with proper validation. Well-defined scope with clear patterns to follow from cmd/update.go. TDD approach adds structure but implementation is straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Implement package resolution logic with dual lookup strategy",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: implementing primary config.yml lookup logic, creating secondary repository definition lookup, designing the resolvePackage function with proper error handling, implementing descriptive error messages following specified formats, and extracting common resolution logic for reuse between commands.",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to dual lookup strategy requiring coordination between config and repository systems. Error handling must be comprehensive with specific message formats. Logic needs to be extractable for reuse, adding architectural considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Modify installer logic to support single package installation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: analyzing existing installer logic and identifying modification points, implementing package filtering before installation loop, creating filtered installation workflow while preserving batch functionality, extracting common installation logic into reusable functions, and ensuring identical behavior for version checking, downloading, and extraction.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity requiring careful modification of existing installer logic without breaking batch functionality. Need to maintain code reuse while adding filtering capability. Critical to preserve all existing behaviors."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Implement comprehensive error handling for selective installation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure as: implementing standardized error message formats matching existing patterns, handling specific error scenarios (package not found, missing repository definitions, network failures), implementing graceful error handling with proper exit codes, and adding error context and debugging support.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to the need for comprehensive error coverage across multiple failure modes. Requires consistency with existing error patterns while adding new scenarios. Error message formatting must be precise and user-friendly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Ensure output consistency between single and batch installation modes",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: analyzing existing output patterns and creating shared formatting functions, implementing consistent progress indicators and status reporting across modes, and validating output format consistency through comprehensive testing.",
			"reasoning": "Lower-medium complexity focused on output consistency. Well-defined scope with existing patterns to follow. Main challenge is ensuring no regression in existing output while maintaining consistency."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Create comprehensive integration test suite",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure as: creating end-to-end workflow tests for complete installation scenarios, implementing GitHub API integration tests with mock responses, developing configuration and repository definition integration tests, creating cross-platform compatibility tests, implementing performance regression tests, and developing realistic test scenarios with temporary environments.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive integration testing requirements across multiple systems. Needs to test real workflows while being deterministic. Performance testing and cross-platform considerations add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Validate backward compatibility and finalize implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: running comprehensive regression testing against existing functionality, validating all success criteria including test coverage targets, conducting performance benchmark comparisons, completing code quality validation and review preparation, and performing final user acceptance testing scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity as final validation task requiring comprehensive testing across all dimensions. Must ensure zero breaking changes while meeting all success criteria. Performance validation and code quality checks add thoroughness requirements."
