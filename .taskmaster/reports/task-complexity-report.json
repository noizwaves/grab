		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create import command structure and CLI interface",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the CLI command creation into: command structure setup, argument validation implementation, URL format validation, and integration with existing root command structure",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward CLI implementation using existing Cobra patterns. Well-defined scope with clear validation requirements. Moderate complexity due to URL validation logic and integration needs."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement GitHub release URL parsing and validation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: URL parsing logic implementation, GitHub URL format validation, org/repo/version extraction, support for different URL formats (tag vs latest), and comprehensive error handling for malformed URLs",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to multiple URL format support and edge case handling. Requires robust parsing logic and comprehensive validation. Critical foundation component for entire import feature."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance GitHub API client for release data fetching",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: GitHub API client extension, GetReleaseByTag method implementation, GetLatestRelease method implementation, asset metadata fetching, authentication handling, and comprehensive error handling for API failures",
			"reasoning": "Complex due to API integration, authentication, error handling for various failure modes (404s, rate limits, network issues), and asset metadata processing. Requires robust implementation for production use."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement release name pattern detection",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: tag pattern analysis logic, regular expression generation, Go template pattern creation, pattern validation and consistency checking, and edge case handling for irregular naming",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to pattern recognition algorithms, regex generation, and template validation. Requires handling diverse naming conventions and ensuring generated patterns are reliable and unambiguous."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Develop asset filename pattern recognition",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: asset filename analysis, platform-specific pattern detection, naming convention parsing, platform alias handling, filename template generation, and validation for complete platform coverage",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to diverse naming conventions across projects, platform alias resolution, and requirement to handle all target platforms. Critical for successful package generation with many edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Create version regex generation logic",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: version string analysis implementation, semantic versioning regex generation, pre-release and build metadata handling, and regex pattern validation against known versions",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity requiring deep understanding of versioning schemes. Need to generate reliable regex patterns that work with grab's existing version matching while handling various formats."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Implement program version detection",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: version argument detection logic, binary execution with timeout handling, version output parsing, regex generation for output formats, and selection of most reliable version detection method",
			"reasoning": "Complex due to binary execution, timeout handling, and parsing diverse version output formats. Requires robust execution environment and careful handling of external process execution."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Create binary path detection and configuration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: archive structure analysis, binary path detection algorithms, cross-platform path consistency validation, and embeddedBinaryPath configuration generation",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity requiring archive analysis and path detection logic. Need to handle various archive structures while ensuring cross-platform consistency."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Develop package YAML specification generator",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: YAML structure generation, pattern integration logic, grab package schema compliance, YAML formatting and validation, and comprehensive output verification",
			"reasoning": "High complexity as this integrates all previous detection results into final output. Must ensure perfect compliance with grab's package format and handle all detected patterns correctly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Implement comprehensive error handling and validation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: error scenario identification, actionable error message creation, exit code implementation, fast-fail validation logic, and edge case error handling",
			"reasoning": "Moderately complex requiring comprehensive understanding of all failure modes. Critical for user experience and must provide clear guidance for resolution."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Create file system integration for package repository",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: repository path resolution, directory creation logic, atomic file writing implementation, and file operation error handling",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with well-defined file operations. Requires atomic operations and proper error handling but follows standard patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Add integration testing and end-to-end validation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: real GitHub repository test setup, end-to-end workflow testing, generated package validation with grab install, failure scenario testing, CI-friendly test implementation, and performance benchmarking",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to end-to-end testing requirements, real external dependencies, performance requirements, and need to validate entire workflow functionality. Critical for ensuring production readiness."
